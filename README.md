### Journal Maker initial specification:

- project name -> entry 1, 2, 3, etc
- select project by name. options to add, edit, remove entries at the bottom
- adding entries should also record the current time in hh:mm  and display at the top. option for named entries too, for entries of note.
- entries should have marked sections as such: overview, challenges, new concepts learned, thoughts. - xml?


first, just get it to simply work.
then, make it look nice.

test by using the entries from making the journal itself
